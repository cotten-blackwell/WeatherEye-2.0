# WeatherEye-2.0
Next-level version of an iPhone weather app that allows our users to check the weather of a specific location whenever they want!

The 2.0 version of the upgraded app adds table views that display the extended forecast data for the current week.

The original app code also showcases foundational concepts like networking and concurrency to use the RESTful API for weather service forecast.io while building on my current knowledge of data modeling, Auto Layout and more. The app also emphasizes how we can structure our code better and construct decoupled classes and structs that lead to greater code reuse.
